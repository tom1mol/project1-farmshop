I was asked to create a website with a number of pages.
I was given a choice of creating a website for a fictitious band or else creating
my own website with my own idea. I chose the latter and I created a website for 
a Motorbike Shop. 

I went over my notes on User Experience Design(UXD) and I looked at the 5 planes 
of UXD and how I could apply them to my project. 
I began by focusing on the strategy plane...what I was looking to achieve.
In order to figure this out I first created a wireframe using a pen and paper. 
This gave me the overall layout for the site with respect to how many linked 
pages I wanted, what images I wanted to apply to the background and foreground 
of the site, the amount of modals I needed for logging in and joining the userlist
and what colours and themes I wanted to apply to the site overall. 


Because UXD strives to achieve a product that works properly and is simple, 
intuitive and enjoyable to use, I tried to build the site from the ground up and 
not to over complicate things.

From a scope perspective I wasn't really looking at the evolution of the site as
it was a one off creation to help me demonstrate some of my newly aquired skills.
At the same time I still had to determine the requirements and key functionality
of the site.
